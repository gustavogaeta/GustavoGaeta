## About Me

👨‍💻 I am a Systems Analysis and Development student at SESI SENAI, passionate about technology and problem-solving.  
💡 I enjoy exploring how software can improve everyday life and constantly seek opportunities to enhance my skills in programming, system design, and IT project management.  
🧠 I have a special interest in software development, databases, and user experience, and I’m eager to apply what I learn in real-world projects.  
🚀 Always learning, always building!
